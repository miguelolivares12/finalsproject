            <p>These are the companies that I went to. I have gathered a lot of experience in every position that I had. The jobs were really hard to do at first but once you have the guide from the seniors of the company, it is very ease to adjust to work life especially when I was just doing my internship. I am a great employee and a loyal one. Whatever position that was given to me, I will gladly take it and fulfill my role to help the compnay progress.</p>
